orcaD Test Plan #2
==================

Initial Preparations:

  - Remove any old logs which may be left from running
    the programs before the test:

       % cd /usr/local/orcaD/logs
       % rm orcad orcactrl
       % cd ../data/

    Make sure you are in the correct directory:
       % pwd
       /usr/local/orcaD/data

    And Run:
       % rm -rf * 
     

TEST #1 -- Killing orcactrl in critical loop

 - Attach bitsyX to the batteries, meterwheel and winch.

  1. Boot the computer and change into orcaD directory
        % cd /usr/local/orcaD

  2. Move package down to 90 meters by running orcactrl
     in the background.

        % ./orcactrl -d 8 move down 90 &

  3. Send orcactrl the HUP signal once the winch
     starts moving:

        <LOTS OF STUFF PRINTING TO SCREEN> 

     Hit return and type "jobs" and hit return again

        % jobs

     In between all the output of the program you
     should see something like:

        [1]+  Running       ./orcactrl move down 90

      
      Hit return and type "kill -HUP %1" and hit return

        % kill -HUP %1

      You should see something like this appear in the
      output **and** the screen output should stop.

        [1]    Hangup       ./orcactrl move down 90 

      The winch should have also shut off.  If not
      Simply type ./iotest WINCHPWR OFF

  4. Place the package back at parking depth:

       % ./orcactrl move up 20



TEST #2 -- Killing orcad in critical loop

  1. Configure the program to run a profile automatically
     and start the orca daemon "orcad".  Again for
     safety sake have someone on the winch controls
     should something go wrong:

     Figure out a good run time:

        % date
        Tue Oct 4 09:17:23 PDT 2005

     Add about 10 minutes to this time ( ie. 9:27 ) 
     and enter it into the config file:

        % nano /usr/local/orcaD/orcad.cfg

     Move down in the file to the mission list and locate
     the "Deep_Cast_Direct" mission:

        [Deep_Cast_Direct]
          schedule = 0 0 * Jan *
          cycles = 1.5
          equilibration_time = 20

     Change the schedule to your desired run time and
     turn the month field to "*":

          schedule = 27 9 * * *

     Save the file and exit the editor.  

  2. Startup the orcad program:

        % cd /usr/local/orcaD
        % ./orcad -d 8 

  3. Check that the program started up correctly:

     Look for orcad in the process listing:
        % ps -e | grep orcad
        #### ?        00:00:00 orcad

     Note the number in the first column.  This is
     the process ID of orcad.  You will use it later
     on to kill the daemon.

     Read the log file:

        % more /usr/local/orcaD/logs/orcad

     If all went well this file should contain
     the line:
    
        ##/##/## ##:##:##: orcad: Main schedule loop starting

     See how much time you have left before the profile
     starts:
  
        % date
        Tue Oct 4 09:24:23 PDT 2005

  4. Kill the daemon once the winch starts the **downcast**.

        % kill -HUP ####

     Use the number from the "ps" command above in the place
     of the "####"s.  The winch should stop moving.  If it 
     doesn't then simply run:

        % ./iotest WINCHPWR OFF

     NOTE: If you think you will not be able to kill the
           daemon before it automatically stops at parking
           depth then wait for the downcast which gives
           you plenty of time to kill the daemon.


  5. Place the package back at parking depth:

       % ./orcactrl view pressure
     
     Depending on the current depth of the
     package move it up or down to 20 meters:

       % ./orcactrl move ??? 20




TEST #3 -- Killing orcad in critical loop whith autostart

  1. Configure the program to run a profile automatically
     and start the orca daemon "orcad".  Again for
     safety sake have someone on the winch controls
     should something go wrong:

     Figure out a good run time:

        % date
        Tue Oct 4 09:17:23 PDT 2005

     Add about 15 minutes to this time ( ie. 9:32 ) 
     and enter it into the config file:

        % nano /usr/local/orcaD/orcad.cfg

     Move down in the file to the mission list and locate
     the "Deep_Cast_Direct" mission:

        [Deep_Cast_Direct]
          schedule = 0 0 * Jan *
          cycles = 1.5
          equilibration_time = 20

     Change the schedule to your desired run time and
     turn the month field to "*":

          schedule = 32 9 * * *

     Save the file and exit the editor.  

  2. Edit the init daemon's configuration file /etc/inittab and
     add orcad to it's list of managed processes:

        % nano /etc/inittab

      Go to the bottom of the file and add or uncomment:

        # Run orcad in runlevel 3
        od:3:respawn:/usr/local/orcaD/orcad -d 8 -f


  3. Tell the init daemon to re-read the /etc/inittab file:

        % /sbin/telinit q

  4. Check that the program started up correctly:

     Look for orcad in the process listing:
        % ps -e | grep orcad
        #### ?        00:00:00 orcad

     Note the number in the first column.  This is
     the process ID of orcad.  You will use it later
     on to kill the daemon.

     Read the log file:

        % more /usr/local/orcaD/logs/orcad

     If all went well this file should contain
     the line:
    
        ##/##/## ##:##:##: orcad: Main schedule loop starting

     See how much time you have left before the profile
     starts:
  
        % date
        Tue Oct 4 09:24:23 PDT 2005

  5. Kill the daemon once the winch starts the downcast.
     This time simulate a bad crash using the "-9" signal:

        % kill -9 ####

     Use the number from the "ps" command above in the place
     of the "####"s.  The winch should stop moving.  If it 
     doesn't then stop the winch manually using the
     auto/manual switch on the buoy.

  6. Check that the program restarted automatically:

     Look for orcad in the process listing:
        % ps -e | grep orcad
        #### ?        00:00:00 orcad

  7. Disable autostart:
   
        % nano /etc/inittab

     Go to the bottom of the file and comment out:
     
        # Run orcad in runlevel 3
        #od:3:respawn:/usr/local/orcaD/orcad -d 8 -f

     Exit the editor and tell the "init" daemon to re-read
     the file:

       % /sbin/telinit q

  8. Kill orcad:
 
        % ps -e | grep orcad
        #### ?        00:00:00 orcad
        % kill -HUP ####
   
  9. Check that its gone:

        % ps -e | grep orcad
        %


SETUP FOR WEEK LONG TEST:

  1. Reboot the computer
  
       % halt
       
     Power cycle.

  2. Edit the /usr/local/orcaD/orcad.cfg file and set 
     run parameters and missions

  3. Rename old testing logs 

       % cd /usr/local/orcaD/logs
       % mv orcad orcad.testplan2
       % mv orcactrl orcactrl.testplan2

     Remove old data files:

       % cd ../data
       % pwd
       /usr/local/orcaD/data
       % rm -rf *

  4. Move to parking depth:

       % cd /usr/local/orcaD
       % ./orcactrl view pressure
       % ./orcactrl move ??? 20

  5. Check that config is correct:

       % ./orcactrl view config

  6. Edit the init daemon's configuration file /etc/inittab and
     add orcad to it's list of managed processes:

        % nano /etc/inittab

     Go to the bottom of the file and add or uncomment:

        # Run orcad in runlevel 3
        od:3:respawn:/usr/local/orcaD/orcad -d 8 -f
  
     Save and exit the editor.  Tell the init daemon to 
     re-read the /etc/inittab file:

        % /sbin/telinit q

  7. Check that orcad has been started:

        % ps -e | grep orcad
        #### ?        00:00:00 orcad

  8. Go home!
